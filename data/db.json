And his first victim is a close friend of Spider-Man's: police Capt. Jean DeWolff, cut down in the prime of her life. Now, the Sin-Eater's killing spree has taken on a new, personal meaning for Spider-Man - and when the wall-crawler finally catches up with the Sin-Eater, Spidey may not be able to check his own fury and rage. In capturing the Sin-Eater, will Spider-Man become as great a danger as that which he pursues? Collecting PETER PARKER, THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN (1976) #107-110 and #134-136.",

With his startling work on Warren Ellis' THOR setting the pace, Deodato's later triumphs on INCREDIBLE HULK, AMAZING SPIDER-MAN and THUNDERBOLTS set the stage for his jaw-dropping visuals on DARK AVENGERS - where the stark, moody character of his work was a perfect match for writer Brian Michael Bendis' deconstruction of Norman Osborn's sanity. THE MARVEL ART OF MIKE DEODATO celebrates the vibrant and vital career of one of comics' elite artists with a bounty of interior and cover art, character sketches, and unpublished work. Featuring commentary from many of Mike's industry peers as well as the artist himself! ",

With Peter Parker's ONE MOMENT IN TIME behind him and Mary Jane back in his life, Spidey finds himself ready for a new start, but the various threads of his life since his BRAND NEW DAY are about to crash together violently. When Norman Osborn's baby is born, every villain on the planet wants the first ever strain of pure Goblin blood, leaving Spider-Man's friends and family exposed to a Sinister plan that threatens to bring down every strand or Peter's life that's been stitched together\ncarefully over the past few years. It may be a cliche to say it, but after ORIGIN OF THE SPECIES absolutely nothing will be the same. Also this issue, we begin a series of covers by the brilliant Marko Djurdjevic that when all put together will form a giant wall-sized Spider poster featuring the people in Spider-Man's life! Plus,the Spidey Sunday feature continues breaking the 4th wall of Web-swinging Wonder by legends Stan Lee and Marcos Martin (well, Stan's a legend, Marcos is just a man who draws like one.)\nRated A $2.99",

It's an election year, and what better way to celebrate than to cast your vote for the one candidate who'll really tell it like it is.

Howard was the archetypal outsider, able to see through the absurdities of human society in the 1970s with uncanny accuracy and an acerbic wit. His adventures presented writer Steve Gerber with a platform from which to engage in an ongoing critique of contemporary fools and pretenders, from power-mad capitalist wizard Pro-Rata to cult leader Reverend Joon Moon Yuc to the dreaded Doctor Bong!

   "description": "Across six issues of truly amazing adventures, Lee, Kirby, and Ditko dreamed up a cadre of ten-story tall menaces from Torr to Manoo to the one and only Monsteroso to trash unwitting Earthlings on a month-in and month-out basis. Backed up by weird tales of wax museums, witchcraft, Martians, and the occult master who set the trenchcoat trend in comics, Dr. Druid, it seemed these titanic tales could never be topped.\r<br>\r<br>And then Stan Lee and Steve Ditko did just that by launching \"The Magazine That Respects Your Intelligence!\" An all-new approach for the young comics sophisticate, Amazing Adult Fantasy presented Twilight Zone-tinged tales of otherworldly aliens, time travel, ghosts, atomic nightmares, and maybe even the secret of the universe itself. With story after lushly-illustrated story, Ditko set a new standard for comic book illustration, and Lee raised the bar ever higher with his scintillating scripts. And, oh, in the last issue they created some guy named \"Spider-Man.\" \r<br>\r<br>Collecting this lynchpin series of Marvel Comics' history for the first time ever, the Amazing Fantasy Omnibus puts AMAZING ADVENTURES #1-6, AMAZING ADULT FANTASY #7-14 and AMAZING FANTASY #15 between two hardcovers 45 years in the making.\r<br>\r<br>416 PGS./All Ages ...$74.99 \r<br>\r<br>ISBN: 0-7851-2458-6 \r<br>",

   "description": "In EARTH X, Captain America, the Fantastic Four, Thor, the Hulk and the X-Men discovered that their purpose - and the meaning of all super heroes and mutated people in the universe - was nothing more than to protect their host planet, in this case Earth, from outside invasion. They learned super heroes are merely biological antibodies to protect a growing embryo within the Earth. An embryo for the Celestial race: This is the way these Gods fought back - only to cause a terrible ecological imbalance, a rift at its core that in time would wipe out all life on the planet. In UNIVERSE X, Captain Marvel was reborn on Earth years after his death. But he also still claimed to walk in the realm of the unliving, where Earth's fallen champions still exist. Mar-Vell led a team of heroes in a quest for the greatest weapons of mass destruction on Earth, suggesting this would limit the destruction caused by the growing power struggle on the planet. But this was not the only reason. For his crusade on Earth only supported and armed a battle he fought in the realm of the fallen, a battle against Death herself. Those living champions who died in his collection of artifacts were added to the battle raging in this other realm. Mar-Vell led a charge against Death and killed her. But now that Death is dead, no one will ever die again. They may writhe in pain in hospitals because their bodies have been broken beyond repair, but they will not die. They will call out for an end to their suffering. They will cry out for peace but there will be no answer. Paradise will be denied them. Yes. Death is truly dead. Long live the living.

   "description": "The clouds are quickly building on the horizon for a storm that will split the Marvel Universe down the middle, and the line is drawn here! You will be asked: Whose side are you on? Well, whose side are you on? Ripped from the pages of NEW AVENGERS comes the explosive hidden story of Marvel Universe's secret past, the secret history of Marvel's most secret team - how they came together, and how they are ripped apart - setting the stage for CIVIL WAR. Meanwhile, Spider-Man's got a new lease on life, new powers and a new costume with some very special features - courtesy of his new best friend, Tony Stark. So what could possibly go wrong? Lots, True Believer. The bonds that Spider-Man now forges may very well determine his capacity to withstand the coming storm. And finally, a mysterious object has fallen from the heavens to crash in the Midwest, and Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four has been called in to try to piece together the mystery surrounding it. What is it, and how will it lead into CIVIL WAR and the return of a Marvel mainstay? Collecting AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #529-531, FANTASTIC FOUR #536-537 and the NEW AVENGERS: ILLUMINATI one-shot.\r<br>160 PGS./Rated T+ ...$14.99\r<br>",

   "description": "Sixteen million mutants dead - and that was just the beginning! In one bold stroke, writer Grant Morrison (All-Star Superman, JLA, FANTASTIC FOUR: 1234) propelled the X-Men into the 21st century - masterminding a challenging new direction for Marvel's mutant heroes that began with the destruction of Genosha and never let up. Regarded as the most innovative thinker of the current comic-book renaissance, Morrison proceeded to turn the mutant-hero genre on its ear. Gone were the gaudy spandex costumes - replaced by slick, black leather and an attitude to match. Now, his entire Eisner Award-nominated run on NEW X-MEN is collected in one deluxe hardcover! Collects NEW X-MEN #114-154 and ANNUAL 2001.\r<br>1096 PGS./Rated T+ ...$99.99\r<br>",

Stories so powerful in message and so grand in scale that the guidelines by which such tales are usually judged are completely rearranged.

Along with writer Jim Krueger and artist John Paul Leon, Ross breathes life into and gives amazing detail to every facet of the EARTH X mythos - made evident by everything from his early conceptual pencil sketches to each of his fourteen beautifully painted covers. EARTH X explores the depths and heights of the Marvel Universe, from the roots of its humble beginnings to the peak of its ultimate potential. \r<br>Collects all twelve issues of the EARTH X regular series, and the #0 and #X bookends.\r<br>472 PGS./Rated T+ ...$29.99\r<br>ISBN: 0-7851-2325-3\r<br>",

Her powers were unremarkable compared to the amazing abilities of the costumed icons that populate the Marvel Universe. In a city of Marvels, Jessica Jones never found her niche. Now a chain-smoking, self-destructive alcoholic with a mean inferiority complex, Jones is the owner and sole employee of Alias Investigations - a small, private-investigative firm specializing in super-human cases.

   "title": "Marvel Visionaries: Stan Lee (Hardcover)",
   "description": "In celebration of its 65th anniversary, the House of Ideas proudly presents a timeless testament to another true Marvel visionary! In 1961, writer Stan Lee penned FANTASTIC FOUR #1, an historic issue unlike any comic book that had come before. This super-hero team had true personalities - they doubted their own abilities, battled problems of money and illness, and even fought among themselves. The monumental popularity of this realistic comic-book style inspired Lee to create similarly themed titles - including HULK, X-MEN and AVENGERS with artist Jack Kirby; and AMAZING SPIDER-MAN with artist Steve Ditko. By 1965, Lee had successfully established Marvel Comics as a cohesive universe populated by world-famous comic-book characters. Now, this deluxe keepsake edition collects his greatest moments - some never before reprinted:\r<br>• \"Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge,\" CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS #3, Stan's first story, a two-page text piece!\r<br>• \"The Red Skull's Deadly Revenge,\" CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS #16, the defining Golden Age Red Skull story!\r<br>• \"The Raving Madman,\" SUSPENSE #29, Stan's satire on Frederick Wertham and the comics witch-hunts of the '50s!\r<br>• \"Where Walks the Ghost,\" AMAZING ADULT FANTASY #11, a short, twist-ending story by Lee and Ditko!\r<br>Plus: \"Spider-Man,\" AMAZING FANTASY #15; \"A Visit With the Fantastic Four,\" FANTASTIC FOUR #11; \"How Stan and Steve Create Spider-Man,\" AMAZING SPIDER-MAN ANNUAL #1; \"In Mortal Combat with Sub-Mariner,\" DAREDEVIL #7; \"Bedlam in the Baxter Building,\" FANTASTIC FOUR ANNUAL #3; \"And Who Shall Mourn for Him?\" SILVER SURFER #5; \"Brother, Take My Hand,\" DAREDEVIL #47; \"And Now, The Goblin,\" \"In the Grip of the Goblin,\" \"The Goblin's Last Stand,\" AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #96-98; \"No More the Thunder God,\" \"When Gods Go Mad,\" \"One God Must Fall,\" THOR #179-181; \"While the World Spins Mad,\" MARVEL PREMIERE #3; and \"The Cycle of Life,\" SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN SUPER-SPECIAL 1995!\r<br>",

Harry's pal, Peter Parker, was truly the type of son Norman Osborn wanted - studious, inventive, strong-willed and industrious. In contrast, Harry had always wilted under life's pressures and the strain of his father's domineering influence, unable to live up to Norman's expectations. Unfortunately, Harry remained unaware of his father's dark side as the Green Goblin until it was too late. Witnessing Norman's apparent death in battle with Spider-Man, Harry was driven to the brink of insanity. Assuming his late father's identity, he began a descent into madness that would haunt him his entire life; only in death could he finally find peace. Now, for the first time ever in one volume, witness the startling tale of Harry's tragic demise in this all-new collection of classic Spider-Man stories! Collects AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #136-137 and #312, and SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN #189 and #200.\"",

Aside from a few hazy tidbits, Wolverine's past has always been little more than a blank slate.  In WEAPON X, acclaimed writer/illustrator Barry Windsor-Smith peels back this veil of secrecy to reveal how Wolverine's skeleton became laced with an indestructible adamantium metal.    Kidnapped and drugged, Wolverine is subjected to a series of sadistic medical experiments designed to create the perfect soldier.  As he battles back against this tortuous experience, Wolverine proves himself to be a true hero long before his days as an X-Man.",
